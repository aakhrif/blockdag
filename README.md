This is a basic implementation of a BlockDAG in GoLang. 
It includes the Block struct with functions for creating blocks, calculating the hash, and the BlockDAG structure with functions for adding blocks and validating the chain. Note that this implementation is minimal and lacks features like consensus mechanisms, persistence, and networking, which are essential components in real-world blockchain systems. For a complete and production-ready implementation, you would need to consider additional aspects and security measures.
